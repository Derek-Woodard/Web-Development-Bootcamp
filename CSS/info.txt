CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
Style sheet language allows us to specify how things will long on the webpage
there are other types of style sheets like Sass or Less

how to add CSS to html website:
inline: <tag style="css" />
internal: <style>css</style>
external: <link href="style.css"/>

Inline: goes within the opening tag of the element you want to style
<html style="background: blue">
</html>

attribute style followed by the CSS code:
first part is the property we want to change: background
the second part is the value you want: blue

inline are useful for adding CSS style to a single element on a page
not as useful for adding style to many parts
not recomended for entire document, only for things like one line, or testing


Internal:
done through special html tag - style:
<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            html {
                background: red;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
</html>

internal style can apply to anymore within an html document
the selector: 
html {
    CSS code
}

the internal styling can apply to any element
usually goes withint the head element

useful for applying to only one html document
not as good for multi-page websites


External:
lives in a completely seperate file
normall called something like styles.css or main.css
has CSS rules in it - selector, style, etc...

to link external, in the index we add a link element:
<html>
    <head>
        <link>
            rel="stylesheet"
            href="directory location of CSS file"
        />
    </head>
</html>

most commonly used style of CSS


CSS selectors:
choosing where to apply CSS

the CSS selctor is the part that selects the html in order to apply the rules within the {}
ie.
h1 {
    color: blue
}
h1 is an element selector - can be any tag
- selects all h1 tags to have the color blue here


class selectors:
.red-heading {
    color: red
}
where red-heading is the name of class being selected

a class can be added as an attribute to any html element
used for grouping elements to have the same CSS element to many things
to apply a class:
<h2 class="class-name">Red</h2>


ID selector:
#main {
    color: red
}
is can be given in the same way as a class selector:
<h2 id="main">Red</h2>
difference between id and class
class can be applied to many elelements
id should only be applied to a single element in an html file
id is completely unique


attribute selector:
p[draggable]{
    color: red
}
attributes include id, class, draggable, href, src
can select elements with particular attributes or particule values to those attributes
above selects all paragraph elements with the element draggable and sets them to red


universal selector:
* {
    color: red
}
selects everything to have the same CSS
