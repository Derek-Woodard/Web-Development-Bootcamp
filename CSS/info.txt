CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
Style sheet language allows us to specify how things will long on the webpage
there are other types of style sheets like Sass or Less

how to add CSS to html website:
inline: <tag style="css" />
internal: <style>css</style>
external: <link href="style.css"/>

Inline: goes within the opening tag of the element you want to style
<html style="background: blue">
</html>

attribute style followed by the CSS code:
first part is the property we want to change: background
the second part is the value you want: blue

inline are useful for adding CSS style to a single element on a page
not as useful for adding style to many parts
not recomended for entire document, only for things like one line, or testing


Internal:
done through special html tag - style:
<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            html {
                background: red;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
</html>

internal style can apply to anymore within an html document
the selector: 
html {
    CSS code
}

the internal styling can apply to any element
usually goes withint the head element

useful for applying to only one html document
not as good for multi-page websites


External:
lives in a completely seperate file
normall called something like styles.css or main.css
has CSS rules in it - selector, style, etc...

to link external, in the index we add a link element:
<html>
    <head>
        <link>
            rel="stylesheet"
            href="directory location of CSS file"
        />
    </head>
</html>

most commonly used style of CSS


CSS selectors:
choosing where to apply CSS

the CSS selctor is the part that selects the html in order to apply the rules within the {}
ie.
h1 {
    color: blue
}
h1 is an element selector - can be any tag
- selects all h1 tags to have the color blue here


class selectors:
.red-heading {
    color: red
}
where red-heading is the name of class being selected

a class can be added as an attribute to any html element
used for grouping elements to have the same CSS element to many things
to apply a class:
<h2 class="class-name">Red</h2>


ID selector:
#main {
    color: red
}
is can be given in the same way as a class selector:
<h2 id="main">Red</h2>
difference between id and class
class can be applied to many elelements
id should only be applied to a single element in an html file
id is completely unique


attribute selector:
p[draggable]{
    color: red
}
attributes include id, class, draggable, href, src
can select elements with particular attributes or particule values to those attributes
above selects all paragraph elements with the element draggable and sets them to red


universal selector:
* {
    color: red
}
selects everything to have the same CSS


Properties:
color properties seen:
background-color: value
- set background color of whole page
color: value
- set color of text

colors are known as named colors
can search for colours at colorhunt.co
- free tool online to find palettes with four different colours

colours have hex codes
colours have rgb values as well (0-255,0-255,0-255)

the hex code can be used instead of the name when choosing the colour


Text properties:
color, font-weight, font-size, font-family

size:
h1 {
    font-size: 20px
}
set the pixel size of the font - 1 pixel ~= 1/96 inch ~= 0.26mm
can also use pt - points
1 point ~= 1/72 inch ~= 0.35mm
standard size 12 in word is 12pt size
em and rem also can be used
em (pronounced m) - 1 em = the entire width of the letter "m"
- meaning if h1 is set to font size 1em, the parent tag h1 is in (so body?) is used
- if the body has a 20pt font-size and an h1 within the body has 2em font size, the h1 will have 40pt size
therfore, em is equal to 100% the parents size, being relative to the parent

rem works the same way (relative) as em, but relative to the root of the html file - normally the html element
rem is a more consistent way of sizing the font

can also use named font sizes like xx-large or large


font weight can be either normal or bold
can use keywords above
can use relative to parent versions such as lighter or bolder
can use a number 100-900 to set a value


font family
font-family determines what you want the text to look like
typefaces include helvetica, sans-serif
where helvetica is what we want, but sans-serif is the backup

serif type fonts are decorated, serif have only right angles

generic type-face is useful because not all computers have all fonts

if the font has multiple words, use quotes: "Times New Roman"

can use custom fonts as well
fonts.google.com
select the font you want and the point size. 
go to selected family pop-up
select link dot and copy link
paste into the font-family html immediately after the style closing tag
copy the CSS rule from google fonts

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Silkscreen&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

font-family: 'Silkscreen', sans-serif;

can now set your fonts to the style you selected


text align:
text-align: center - sets the alignment of the text
values include: left, right, center, left, right
left and right change where the start and end of line are
- can start on right side and type from right to left
