    <h2>Carleton University Ravens Swim Team</h2>
    <h3>September 2018 - April 2022</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p> joined the swim team after having only started swimming in 2016, showing dedication
            to personal improvement and the ability to work towards a goal regardless of my current
            skill</p></li>
        <li><p> balanced my studies with participating in five to eight swim
            practices a week, each lasting 90-105 minutes</p></li>
        <li><p>In my first year on the team (September 2018 - April 2019), I was given the “Most
            Dedicated” award by the head coaches due to my consistency in coming to workouts
            and working hard to improve my swimming</p></li>
        <li><p>In my third year on the team (September 2020 - April 2021), I was made a team captain,
            responsible for being the voice of the team when communicating with the coaches and
            keeping team morale high while consistently participating in a minimum of four 105
            minute practices a week</p></li>
