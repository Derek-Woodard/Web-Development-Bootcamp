<!-- 
html means HyperText Markup Language
HTML tags used to markup code - making paragraphs and headings
tags noted as <tag>
headers have opening and closing tags:
opening - <h1>
closing - </h1>

the element is between the the openinging tag, the content and the closing tag

headings only go from 1 to 6. There is no h7

only have a single h1 - top level heading
don't skip levels - always go 1,2,3,4,5,6
these don't break anything, they are just convention

the following shows all details about elements:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements

paragraphs work as following:
<p> content </p>

can use lipsum.com (lorem ipsum) to generate natural placeholder paragraphs for testing
baconipsum.com for novelty version
broipsum.com for novelty version 

void elemets - horizontal rule and break elements
void elements can have no content
horizontal rule element: <hr />
creates a horizontal line at the location

break element: <br />
separates lines at location - useful for things like poems to structure properly

use new paragbraph element when needing to separate paragraphs. Don't use breaks within a paragraph

for horizontal rule and break, the / is not needed
ie. <hr > or <br >
