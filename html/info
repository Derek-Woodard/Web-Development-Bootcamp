html means HyperText Markup Language
HTML tags used to markup code - making paragraphs and headings
tags noted as <tag>
headers have opening and closing tags:
opening - <h1>
closing - </h1>

the element is between the the openinging tag, the content and the closing tag

headings only go from 1 to 6. There is no h7

only have a single h1 - top level heading
don't skip levels - always go 1,2,3,4,5,6
these don't break anything, they are just convention

the following shows all details about elements:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements

paragraphs work as following:
<p> content </p>

can use lipsum.com (lorem ipsum) to generate natural placeholder paragraphs for testing
baconipsum.com for novelty version
broipsum.com for novelty version 

void elemets - horizontal rule and break elements
void elements can have no content
horizontal rule element: <hr />
creates a horizontal line at the location

break element: <br />
separates lines at location - useful for things like poems to structure properly

use new paragbraph element when needing to separate paragraphs. Don't use breaks within a paragraph

for horizontal rule and break, the / is not needed
ie. <hr > or <br >

ordered and unordered lists:
unordered list create bullet points: 
<ul>
<li>tag 1</li>
<li>tag 2</li>
</ul>

ordered list create numbered lists (1. 2. 3.):
<ol>
<li>tag 1</li>
<li>tag 2</li>
</ol>

nesting and indentation
you can nest a list inside another list
keep in mind indentation to show start and end of the nested list
to nest a list - note the list item ends AFTER the nested list:
<li> item
    <ul>
        <li> item </li>
    </ul>
</li>

anchor elements:
<a href="link here"> put link text here </a>
href is the attribute that connects to the url you want to use
uses attributes
<tag attribute=value>Content</tag>
can have as many attributes as you want:
<tag attribute=value anotherattribute=value>Content</tag>

image elements:
<img src="url" />
src = source = what is the source of the image
"url" is the location of the image
image elements are void elements
<img src="https://picsum.photos/200" /> can be used to get placeholder photos
the 200 represents the size of the picture - 200 x 200 pixel picture
attribute:
alt="alternative text description"
useful for people with visual impairments

File Paths:
absolute and relative paths
absolute:
relative to the root of the computer (C:drive)
relative:
relative to the location the current file is in
relative are always valid if the folder moves around
special characters:
../ means to go up one level
./ means to stay in the current directory
./ is not strictly needed to look into the current directory - doesn't always work though

html boiler plate and proper html structure
boilerplate is what you start with when  making a new html file
format:
<!DOCTYPE html> % says which version of html is being used
<html lang="en"> % opening tag of html element - lang is the language
    <head> %includes things that help the website render properly - not visible
        <meta charset="UTF-8"> meta tag ensures characters used on website are displayed correctly - certain ones won't render emojis, certain ones won't show symbols - UTF-8 is among the most commmon
        <title>My Website</title> % shows title displayed in the tab for the website
    </head>

    <body> % where the content of the website go - text, links, etc...
        % in here are headings, images, links, etc...
    </body>
</html> %closing tag of html element

template for copy/paste:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
        <title>My Website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        
    </body>
</html>
