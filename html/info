HTML tags used to markup code - making paragraphs and headings
tags noted as <tag>
headers have opening and closing tags:
opening - <h1>
closing - </h1>

the element is between the the openinging tag, the content and the closing tag

headings only go from 1 to 6. There is no h7

only have a single h1 - top level heading
don't skip levels - always go 1,2,3,4,5,6
these don't break anything, they are just convention
